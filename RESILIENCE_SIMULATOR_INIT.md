## 1. Project Overview and Philosophy

### Mission Statement
The Interactive Resilience Simulator empowers content creators to develop psychological resilience against online harassment through safe, experiential learning in a simulated environment before encountering these stressors in real life.

### Core Principles

#### a. Experiential Learning
- **Active Decision-Making**: Players learn through making strategic choices in simulated stressful situations
- **Skill Development**: Creates instinctive responses for real-world harassment scenarios
- **Learning by Doing**: Moves beyond passive advice to active practice

#### b. Safe Experimentation
- **Risk-Free Environment**: Creators can experiment with different response strategies without real consequences
- **Controlled Failure**: Wrong reactions (e.g., angry replies to trolls) can be explored safely
- **Reset Capability**: Players can try again without permanent damage to reputation or mental health

#### c. Feedback and Reflection
The game uses two primary meters to visualize consequences:

- 🧠 **Mental Health Meter**: 
  - Tracks psychological well-being
  - Ranges from stress to resilience
  - Immediate visual feedback on emotional impact

- ✅ **Community Trust Meter**: 
  - Measures audience and fanbase perception
  - Shows long-term reputation effects
  - Demonstrates social consequences of actions

#### d. Positive Reinforcement of Healthy Behavior
- **Reward-Focused Design**: Emphasizes celebrating correct strategies over punishing mistakes
- **Visual Feedback**: Meters rise when using healthy strategies (blocking, professional communication)
- **Habit Formation**: Creates neurological feedback loops that reinforce positive behaviors

#### e. Scaffolded Practice + Self-Generated Mastery
- **Guided Progression**: Starts with multiple-choice options (safe guardrails)
- **Skill Transfer**: Concludes with free-form written responses
- **Behavioral Scripts**: Transforms abstract knowledge into personal action plans

## 3. Hate Comments Badge Detailed Flow

### Phase 0: Introduction
**Narrative Setup:**
> "You've just uploaded a video. The first few responses are positive. Suddenly, the hate begins. This badge will guide you through how to respond when faced with direct, personal attacks."

**Initial State:**
- Mental Health: 100
- Community Trust: 100

---

### Phase 1: First Reaction
**Scenario:** 
> Comment appears: "You're so cringe. Delete your channel."

**Choice Options:**
1. **Reply Angrily** 
   - Immediate effect: +5 Mental Health (cathartic release)
   - Secondary effect: -20 Community Trust
   
2. **Ignore It**
   - Immediate effect: 0 Community Trust change
   - Secondary effect: -10 Mental Health (internalized stress)

---

### Phase 2: Consequences
**Anger Path Result:**
- Trolls pile on: "so sensitive lol"
- Additional -20 Community Trust loss
- Lesson: "Feeding trolls amplifies negativity"

**Ignore Path Result:**
- Silence interpreted as weakness
- Additional -10 Mental Health loss
- Lesson: "Pure avoidance drains you internally"

**Transition Message:**
> "Neither silence nor anger is sustainable. Let's explore constructive approaches."

---

### Phase 3: Healthy Strategy Introduction
**New Scenario:**
> Comment appears: "Stop stealing content, loser."

**Constructive Options:**
1. **Block/Report User**
   - Effect: Troll disappears from view
   - Result: +15 Mental Health, Trust stable
   
2. **Pin Positive Fan Comment**
   - Effect: Positivity amplified in comment section
   - Result: +10 Mental Health, +20 Community Trust

Both choices are rewarded to show multiple valid strategies.

---

### Phase 4: Escalation Event
**Narrative:** 
> "The hate intensifies. Trolls begin spamming across multiple posts."

**Critical Decision:**
1. **Public Angry Rant Post**

## 6. Technical Architecture Notes

### Frontend-First Philosophy
This project is designed as a **client-side application** with minimal backend dependencies, emphasizing browser-based state management and avoiding traditional database requirements.

### Core Technical Decisions

#### State Management
- **Client-Side Only**: All game state lives in browser
- **Session Storage**: Progress saved locally
- **No User Accounts**: Anonymous gameplay by default
- **Ephemeral Data**: No persistent server storage required

#### Data Architecture
- **Static Content**: Scenarios/badges as JSON files
- **CDN Delivery**: Content served from edge locations
- **Version Control**: Git-based content updates
- **No Database**: Eliminates server costs and complexity

### Component Architecture

#### React-Based Structure
```javascript
// Core components
- GameController (orchestrates flow)
- ScenarioCard (displays content)
- ChoiceButton (handles interactions)
- MeterDisplay (visualizes consequences)
- BadgeGallery (shows achievements)
- PracticeMode (free-form input)
```

#### State Management Options
- **Context API**: For simple state sharing
- **Redux Toolkit**: If complexity grows
- **Local Storage**: For progress persistence
- **Session Storage**: For temporary state

### Data Structures

#### Scenario JSON Schema
```json
{
  "badge": "hate-comments",
  "phase": 1,
  "narrative": "Scenario text...",
  "choices": [
    {
      "id": "angry",
      "text": "Reply angrily",
      "effects": {
        "mentalHealth": 5,
        "communityTrust": -20
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Progress Tracking
```javascript
{
  currentBadge: "hate-comments",
  currentPhase: 3,
  completedBadges: ["intro"],
  meters: {
    mentalHealth: 85,
    communityTrust: 70
  }
}
```

### Backend Minimalism
